# words_api

Serves random words for use with [Svelte Typing Test](https://github.com/mdjohns/svelte_type).
- Accepts `GET` requests to `/word?n=#` with `n` being the number of words to fetch
- `words.json` pulled from [RazorSh4rk's Random Word API](https://github.com/RazorSh4rk/random-word-api). Just wanted to build the backend myself.
- [Deployed to Heroku](https://gimme-words.herokuapp.com/)
